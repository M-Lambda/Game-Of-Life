# Game of Life
For a 4 day project, I chose to teach myself Vue.js and challenged myself by doing Game of Life as my first project using Vue.
## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
